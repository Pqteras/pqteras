# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

I like to code - Theocharis

This is my first-ever attempt to make a personal portfolio about what I do and my skills in the programming world. I'd appreciate your input if you spot anything in my code that doesn't look quite professional. I'm all about getting better at programming, step by step, every day.

- Made with React & Next.JS
